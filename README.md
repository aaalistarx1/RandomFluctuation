# RandomFluctuationðŸ«§
This project is an interactive web-based visualization of Brownian motion, illustrating the random movement of particles. 


## FeaturesðŸŽ‡
- **Brownian Motion Simulation**: Visualizes the random, jittery movements characteristic of particles in Brownian motion.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts the visualization and background image to fit the screen size, ensuring the line always starts from the center of the canvas.
