# RandomFluctuationðŸ«§

This project is an interactive web-based visualization of Brownian motion, illustrating the random movement of particles. It features a dynamic, time-based wavy background that creates an engaging visual effect.

## FeaturesðŸŽ‡

- **Time-Based Wavy Background**: Displays a visually dynamic, wavy background that changes based on the time of day, adding depth and movement to the visualization.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Users can click anywhere on the canvas to initiate a new Brownian motion sequence from that point, providing an interactive element to the simulation.
- **Brownian Motion Simulation**: Visualizes the random, jittery movements characteristic of particles in Brownian motion.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts the visualization and background to fit the screen size, ensuring the line always starts from the center of the canvas upon initial load and mouse click.
